I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on developing exciting applications. I'm a self-taught engineer, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

I also founded [Raihan Software](https://raihansoftware.co.id), a software development company that focuses on developing web applications for small and medium-sized businesses on global market.

I'm writing a blog where I share my knowledge and experiences in software development. The blogs are product of my learning journey and my passion for software development. There will be a lot of mistakes and errors in my blogs, but I believe that's the best way to learn.

The best way to enjoy my blog is to explore by categories, tags, or archives because I will post literally anything that I find interesting without any particular order.

Feel free to reach me at <raihan@raihansoftware.co.id> if you have any questions or projects that we can work together!
