## Introduction

Raven Raffles is a product of a Raven Restocks. I'm the one in charge to develop it from ground up to production.
They gave me privilage to choose any technology to build as long as with Python, and They also provided me with complete UI/UX design.

## Problem

Sneakers Brands and Distributors usually has Raffle Competition, where people gather and join the (sort of) giveaway where they will pick people randomly for a sneakers with a retail price.

Why people really want it? because we could resell the sneakers with a BIG margin of profit, and sneakers has its own market - people will buy it.

## Solution

Because it is VERY hard to win raffle. In order to win this Raffle, or at least have advantages on chances to win than others. We could join multiple times with multiple identity, payment methods, and etc.

We provide BOT to automatically join any raffles and have GREATER chances of winning than others.
